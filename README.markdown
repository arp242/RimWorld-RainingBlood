This is an example RimWorld mod, buildable on Linux. This belongs to my [Getting
started with RimWorld modding on Linux][post], so see that for more information.

The LICENSE is "0BSD", which is essentially "do what you want". Feel free to use
this as a template to build a mod without worrying about copying the license or
attribution or whatnot â€“ I don't care.
